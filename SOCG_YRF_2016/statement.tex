My name is Tyler Mayer, I am a 3rd year PhD student  at Stony Brook University advised by Dr. Joseph Mitchell and Dr. Esther Arkin.  My research interests are in Computational Geometry and Graph Algorithms.  I would like to apply for financial support to attend CG week 2016.

I have submitted a talk to the SoCG YRF and hope to be a presenter at this event.   I am very excited about meeting other young researchers and newly established professionals to spark new collaboration.   Also, I am very excited about attending the SoCG workshops this year, in particular the ``Geometric Computing on Uncertain Data'' workshop as much of my research related to my thesis is on this subject.

I have no other sources of funding to attend this event, the entire expense would be out of pocket otherwise.


Thank you for your consideration.


Tyler Mayer
